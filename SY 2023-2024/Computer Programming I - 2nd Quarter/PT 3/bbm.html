            <h1>Marcos says joint patrols with US have started in West Philippine Sea</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday announced that the Philippines and the United States have started their three-day joint maritime and air patrols in the West Philippine Sea.</p>
                <p>“Today (Tuesday) marks the beginning of joint maritime and air patrols — a collaborative effort between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the United States Indo-Pacific Command in the West Philippine Sea,” he said on his social media accounts. But the president did not specify where the joint patrols are in the West Philippine Sea, other than to say these would continue until Thursday. Marcos said the joint activity was aimed at enhancing the interoperability — or the capacity of military equipment of both military forces to operate in conjunction with each other — in patrolling the area.</p>
                <p>“This significant initiative is a testament to our commitment to bolster the interoperability of our military forces in conducting maritime and air patrols. Through collaborative efforts, we aim to enhance regional security and foster a seamless partnership with the United States in safeguarding our shared interests,” he said.</p>
                <p>The president said the joint maritime and air patrols are part of a series of events agreed upon by the Mutual Defense Board-Security Engagement Board (MDB-SEB) of both nations.
                <p>The MDB-SEB is a framework for security and cooperation, providing an opportunity for the Philippines and the United States to exchange views on security concerns and plan the range of military activities they will conduct the following year, including the “Balikatan” exercises that are held annually. In 2012, the Philippine government, asserting its sovereign rights over the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), renamed the portion of the South China Sea comprising the maritime areas of the western side of the Philippine archipelago as the West Philippine Sea. The West Philippine Sea includes the Luzon Sea as well as the waters around, within, and adjacent to the Kalayaan Island Group and Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal), according to Administrative Order No. 29 issued by former President Benigno Aquino III. The announcement came a day after the president told a forum in Hawaii that the situation in the South China Sea, most of which is claimed by Beijing, had become more “dire than it was before.”. Noting that a broader agreement with China has not progressed, he said the Philippines was working instead on a code of conduct with its neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) with conflicting claims on the South China Sea. “We are still waiting for the code of conduct between China and Asean and the progress has been rather slow, unfortunately,” he lamented. Late Monday night, however, China expressed its opposition to Mr. Marcos’ proposal, insisting that Asean must stick to their previous agreement. “Any departure from the DOC framework and its spirit will be null and void,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning said in a press briefing in Beijing, referring to the nonbinding Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) signed between China and Asean in 2002.</p>
